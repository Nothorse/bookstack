# bookstack #

A small webapp to manage ebook (epub) collections. It's certainly me-ware as I wrote it for my own use, but t should be usable by anyone with a minor tech know-how.
The perfect scenario is use on a home server (I use a Raspberry Pi), with the books accessible through the web app. Additionally I have my library directory on Dropbox for ease of access on the road.

## what it does ##
* sorts the files into a directory hierarchy
* maintains a sqlite metadata database for access and quicksearch
* can edit limited metadata
* can use [tenprintcover](https://github.com/mgiraldo/tenprintcover-py) as a cover generator
* download/add books through the web app
* can trigger download through [FanFicFare](https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare)
